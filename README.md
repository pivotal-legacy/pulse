## Description

ProjectMonitor is a CI aggregator to help teams monitor the status of their builds.
The project consists of 3 primary components:
* Pulse CI Build API [postman](ci.pivotallabs.com)
* [Pulse Management Tool](frontend/README.md)
* Pulse Monitor Display [demo](ci.pivotallabs.com)

![](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/images/labs/tools/project_monitor.png)

The intent of pulse is to display the status of multiple Continuous Integration builds on a single web page.
Displaying the status of all your projects' builds on a big screen monitor or TV provides a highly visible/glanceable resource
for the development team to triage any issues!

Pulse currently supports:
* WIP - we're doing a refactor!

Roadmap for integration
* Travis-CI

List of potential integrations:
* CircleCI
* Codeship
* Concourse
* Cruise Control
* Jenkins
* Semaphore
* Solano CI (formerly loved as tddium)
* TeamCity

We use Pulse internally at Pivotal Labs to display the status of the builds for all our client projects.
We also have an instance of Pulse running at [ci.pivotallabs.com](ci.pivotallabs.com) that we use for displaying the status of the builds
of various open source projects - both of projects Pivotal Labs maintains (such as Jasmine)
and of non-Pivotal projects (such as Rails).

## Installation

This project uses React and Redux for its frontend component and SpringBoot for its backend api server.

The installation instructions for the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/blob/master/frontend/README.md)  
The installation instructions for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/blob/master/backend/README.md)  

The integration tests are written using Capybara and are located [here](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/tree/master/integration_tests)  

Each README in their respective folders contains information about running each piece manually, alternatively you may use the
`run.sh` script in the [ci](https://github.com/pivotal/pulse/blob/master/ci/run.sh) directory to run the tests and start 
the frontend and backend processes.
